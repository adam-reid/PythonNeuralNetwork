# PythonNeuralNetwork
First Neural Network as copied from the interwebs. This is my training example that I found online and is not original work. I've added some of my own comments to this to help myself in my own curiosity.

## One-level Neural Network
The first example is in `neuralnetwork.py`. This walks through a one-layer network, as provied in reference #1 below.

## Two-level Neural Netowrk
The second example is in `2layerneuralnetwork.py` (no wai!). This walks through a two-layer network, as provided in reference #3.

## Next work
The next phase will be a 3-layer network implemented from the blog at I Am Trask, also in reference #3 below.
